      "Include the salt and the flour into the filling and stir it until they get creamy, but not runny. Add a tiny bit flour if it feels too runny? Do some sample tasting if it needs any tweaks for ya. If you're finished, cover the pot with a lid and let it coool (Skip to walnut filling to save time)",
      "After it has cooled down, grate 1 lemon and 1 orange skin into it.",

      "Pour the warm milk into them and stir it. Don't let it be too dry or too runny. Do some sample tasting if it needs any tweaks for ya.",
      "ASSEMBLING TIMEEEEE! Take out 1 dumpling dough, knead them out into a rectangle / square shape if you can (I was only able to make ellipses). The dough's width should be around 5-7 mm. (Using a roller with warm water in the cylinder can help greatly. The dough was really sticky for me ngl)",
      "Spread half of the walnut or coconut filling on the dough as evenly as you can with leaving 1 cm space on all sides. ONLY FOR THE COCONUT: Smash the chocolate into tiny pieces and sprinkle them on the fillings evenly. Do this for all the 3 remaining dumplings",
      "Press down the left and right edge of the dough with your fingers, then fold those ONCE and press them down a bit again. This one helps to create a better aesthetic look after the baking will finished",
      "Roll up the from down-to-top gently and lubricate the rolls with 1 egg yolk and put them into the freezer for 15 mins",
      "Lubricate it with egg whites, wait a bit and just put them into the oven for 200 Celsius in upper-under baking mode to 35 minutes (or just watch until it looks tastyyy :3). If you have a modern oven, you probably need to lower the heat to 160 C, I have accidentally ruined this masterpiece",

      "Gently transfer the dough onto the tray and let it rest for 1 hours atleast",
      "Put A GENEROUS amount of oil onto the dough and \"pimple & dimple\" it. This means creating a bunch of holes in the dough by gently pressing all of your fingers into the mass and jiggle it a bit. If your dough isn't covering your entire tray then you can solve this by stretching the dough outwards while your fingers are inside",
      "As a check be sure that the dough has a LOT of holes with a generous amount of oil covering them. Take out a brush or your hands and spread oil on every parts of the dough's surface. This approach should prevent the crumb being crunchy too fast which would take away precious time from the inner structure being baked properly",
      "Sprinkle rosemary and potentionally other ingredients you wish to add (for tomatoes: Press out some liquid of them beforehand, and deeply press them into the dough, so that they will sit at the bottom)",
